# week-2-project
 
This project was created using almost only ChatGPT with minor edits.

The initial prompt for ChatGPT was "create simple layout with clickable links to photos of nyc mayors using html, css, and jQuery."

This was perfect except ChatGPT added placeholder links and did not find actual mayors but instead included Mayor 1, Mayor 2, Mayor 3, and Mayor 4. I edited the text to name actual mayors and found image links to replace the placeholder links.

To add more complexity, I prompted ChatGPT to "create a table using html, jquery, and css that provides biological facts about each mayor." This worked, but ChatGPT only include HTML and jQuery code. To account for this, I asked ChatGPT to "add css to above code to stylize similar to the following css code [copied css from initial ChatGPT prompt]."
